			Thank you for visiting my website and wanting to get to know me a bit more! As you can guess, my name is Sky and I would describe myself as a dopamine addict. Whenever I find something new that I'm even remotely interested in, I just jump in and do the best job that I can. Over the years I've explored many different interests, and the things that seem to really stick for me are Game Design and my Musicianship! 
I've been designing games and learning as much as I can about them ever since my middle school days. I remember creating Hunger Games maps with my friends in creative mode and creating really complex redstone builds in all of my worlds. I didn't find Unity until highschool, but I had some experience coding already when I did. I had started teaching myself Javascript online a couple years prior. 
In highschool I focused on Photography and Videography and ended up creating some news packages for PBS and commercial material for some other small buisnesses as a freelance videographer in my junior year. My senior year I switched highschools to take AP Computer Science and dedicated my entire year to learning as much as I could about game design! I got accepted to the University of California , Santa Cruz as a Computer Science : Game Design major in 2019.
This is where things get tricky for me. You see, 2020 really threw me for a loop and physically took me away from the college campus which was really traumatic and disappointing. I never lost sight of my passion though, I used my extra time in isolation to teach myself more programming and game design concepts. I ended up being able to move back up to Santa Cruz after securing a job, and then decided to take a leave of absence from school and work full time so that I could come home and continue to work on my games. 
I joined iDTech in February of 2021 to be an online instructor for students across the world in game design topics! With this job I've been able to learn so many new things as well as teach them to my students, which has been an absolute pleasure. The company also provided me a VR headset to teach students how to create VR games with Unity, which is something that I've been wanting to do for years! I've been able to grow along with my students and learn more and more about game development.
I have no doubt that I would like to pursue a game development career, in whatever form that comes in. Game development is the one thing that allows me to flex all of my creative and logical talents on one project! I can program, create digital assets, compose the music, and even create a directed story with good shot composition all in one project! 
Thanks again for looking at my website, it really means a lot to me.
I love creating , and I hope you enjoy the things I create.
